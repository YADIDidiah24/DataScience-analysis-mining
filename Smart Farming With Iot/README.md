# Crop Recommendation Model

The file `crop_recommendation.ipynb` contains the code for building a crop recommendation model. Here's a breakdown of what's included:

## Data Preprocessing:

- Reading and loading the dataset containing attributes such as nitrogen content, phosphorous content, temperature, humidity, pH value, rainfall, and corresponding crop labels.
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the structure and distribution of the data.
- Preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.

## Model Training and Evaluation:

- Selection of machine learning algorithms including Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naive Bayes, Linear Regression, and Logistic Regression.
- Training each model on the training data and evaluating its performance using metrics like accuracy and F1 score.
- Comparison of model performances to determine the most effective algorithm for crop recommendation.

## Visualization:

- Visualization of model evaluation metrics using plots to provide insights into the performance of each algorithm.
- Scatter plot and correlation matrix analysis to understand the relationship between environmental attributes and crop types.

# Crop Yield Prediction Model

The file `crop_yield_prediction.ipynb` contains the code for predicting crop yield based on environmental factors. Here's a summary of what's covered:

## Data Analysis and Preprocessing:

- Loading and analyzing a dataset containing information about crop yield, rainfall, pesticides, and temperature.
- Exploratory data analysis to understand the distribution and relationships between different attributes.
- Preprocessing steps including encoding categorical variables and splitting the data into training and testing sets.

## Model Selection and Training:

- Selection of a decision tree regressor model for predicting crop yield.
- Training the model on the training data and evaluating its performance using the R-squared metric.
- Implementation of ensemble learning techniques including BaggingRegressor for further improvement.

## Visualization:

- Visualization of the predicted yield compared to the actual yield to assess the performance of the model.
- Comparison of the decision tree regressor and ensemble model results through scatter plots.

# Weather Forecasting Model

The file `weather_forecasting.ipynb` contains the code for forecasting weather using time series data. Here's what's included:

## Data Preprocessing:

- Loading and preprocessing a time series dataset containing attributes such as date, mean temperature, humidity, wind speed, and mean pressure.
- Handling missing values and converting categorical variables.

## Model Implementation and Evaluation:

- Implementation of the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model for time series forecasting.
- Training the ARIMA model on the preprocessed data and making predictions.
- Evaluation of the model's performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Akaike Information Criterion (AIC).

## Visualization:

- Visualization of the predicted weather values compared to the actual values over the specified time period.
- Presentation of evaluation metrics to assess the accuracy and reliability of the forecasting model.

These code files collectively demonstrate the application of machine learning and time series forecasting techniques to optimize agricultural practices and enhance decision-making in farming.
